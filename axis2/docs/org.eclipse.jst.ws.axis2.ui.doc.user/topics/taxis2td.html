<h1 class="topictitle1">Creating a Java bean skeleton from a WSDL document using the Apache
Axis2 runtime environment</h1>




<div><p>The Web service wizard assists you in creating a skeleton bean
from an existing WSDL document. The skeleton bean contains a set of methods
that correspond to the operations described in the WSDL document. When the
bean is created, each method has a trivial implementation that you replace
by editing the bean.</p>

<div class="p"><p>Prerequisites:</p>
<ol>
<li>You must have installed the Apache Axis2 runtime
environment as described in: <a href="caxis2tover.html" title="This runtime environment is for users who prefer to develop for&#10;the open Apache Axis platform. Both Axis1 and Axis2 are supported by the Web&#10;services tools.">Creating Web services with the Apache Axis2 runtime environments</a></li>

<li>If you are using the Apache Jakarta Tomcat servlet
container as your server, you must install it, configure an instance of it,
and create a Web project targeted to it as described in: <a href="../org.eclipse.jst.ws.axis.ui.doc.user/topics/ttomcatserv.html">Creating an Apache Tomcat server and Web project</a></li>

<li>Create or import a WSDL file into the Web Content folder of the Web project.
You can only use a WSDL file that contains a service element.</li>

</ol>
</div>

<div class="section">To create a Web service from a WSDL file using the Apache Axis2 runtime
environment:</div>

<ol>
<li><span>Switch to the Java EE perspective (<span class="uicontrol">Window &gt; Open Perspective
&gt; Java EE</span>).</span></li>

<li><span>In the Project Explorer view, select the WSDL file that you created
or imported into the Web Content folder of your Web project.</span></li>

<li><span>Click  <span class="uicontrol">File &gt; New &gt; Other</span>. Select  <span class="uicontrol">Web
Services</span> in order to display the various Web service wizards.
Select the  <span class="uicontrol">Web Service</span> wizard. Click  <span class="uicontrol">Next</span>.</span>
</li>

<li><span>Web Services page: select  <span class="uicontrol">Top down Java bean Web service</span> as
your Web service type, and enter the URI to the WSDL, WSIL, or HTML file that
will be used to generate the service.</span>
<ol type="a">
<li class="substepexpand"><span>Select the stages of Web services development that you want
to complete using the slider:</span> <ul>
<li>Develop: this will develop the WSDL definition and implementation of the
Web service. This includes such tasks as creating the modules which will contain
the generated code, WSDL files, deployment descriptors, and Java™ files
when appropriate.</li>

<li>Assemble: this ensures the project that will host the Web service or client
gets associated to an EAR when required by the target application server.</li>

<li>Deploy: this will create the deployment code for the service.</li>

<li>Install: this will install and configure the Web module and EARs on the
target server.</li>

<li>Start: this will start the server once the service has been installed
on it. The server-config.wsdd file will be generated.</li>

<li>Test: this will provide various options for testing the service, such
as using the Web Service Explorer or sample JSPs.</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li class="substepexpand"><span>Select your server: the default server is displayed. If you
want to deploy your service to a different server click the link to specify
a different server.</span></li>

<li class="substepexpand"><span>Select your runtime: ensure the Apache Axis2 runtime is selected.</span>
</li>

<li class="substepexpand"><span>Select the service project: the project selected in your workspace
is displayed. To select a different project click on the project link. If
you are deploying to WebSphere<sup>®</sup> Application Server you will also be asked
to select the EAR associated with the project.</span> Ensure that the
project selected as the Client Web Project is different from the Service Web
Project, or the service will be overwritten by the client's generated artifacts.
</li>

<li class="substepexpand"><span>If you want to create a client, select the type of proxy to
be generated and repeat the above steps for the client.</span></li>

<li class="substepexpand"><span>Publish the Web service: this will launch the Web Services Explorer
to publish your Web service to a UDDI registry.</span></li>

<li class="substepexpand"><span>Monitor the Web service: this will send the Web service traffic
through the TCP/IP Monitor, which allows you to watch the SOAP traffic generated
by the Web service and to test this traffic for WS-I compliance. Alternately
you can manually set up a TCP/IP monitor as described in <a href="../../org.eclipse.wst.wsi.ui.doc.user/tasks/tmonitor.html">Using the TCP/IP Monitor to test Web services</a></span></li>

</ol>

</li>

<li><span>Axis2 Web Service Skeleton Java Bean Configuration page: Select the
folder where the generated Java will be stored. If you want to review
or edit the mappings between packages and namespaces, select the  <span class="uicontrol">Define
custom mapping for namespace to package</span> check box. Click  <span class="uicontrol">Next</span>.</span>
<ol type="a">
<li><span>Service Name: accept the default.</span></li>

<li><span>Port Name:accept the default.</span></li>

<li><span>Databinding Name: Only the Axis2 Databinding Framework (ADB)
is supported at this time.</span></li>

<li><span>Custom package name: You can change the package name in this
field.</span></li>

<li><span>Generate an Interface for Skeleton</span></li>

<li><span>Generate all types for all elements referred by schemas</span>
</li>

<li><span>Namespace to package mapping: Use this table to review or edit
the mappings between packages and namespaces.</span></li>

</ol>

</li>

<li><span>Test Web Service page: If you selected to test the Web service,
select the test facility for the generated Web service. This will open the
Web service in the Web Services Explorer. Select the operation you want to
test, enter the required information, and click  <span class="uicontrol">Go</span>.
The result will display in the Status pane. Click  <span class="uicontrol">Next</span>.</span>
</li>

<li><span>Axis2 Client Web service configuration
page: Use this page to select the following options: </span>
<ol type="a">
<li><span>Service Name: accept the default.</span></li>

<li><span>Port Name: accept the default.</span></li>

<li><span>Databinding Name: only the Axis2 Databinding Framework (ADB)
is supported at this time.</span></li>

<li><span>Custom package name: You can change the package name in this
field.</span></li>

<li><span>Client mode: You can choose if the client is synchronous, asynchronous,
or both.</span></li>

<li><span>Generate test case to test the service: If you select this,
the Axis2 emitter will generate JUnit testcases matching the WSDL provided
to the client. These JUnit testcases will be generated to a newly added source
directory to the client project called <span class="uicontrol">test</span>. </span>
</li>

<li><span>Generate all types for all elements referred by schemas</span>
</li>

<li><span>Namespace to package mapping: Use this table to review or edit
the mappings between packages and namespaces.</span></li>

</ol>

</li>

<li><span>Web Service Client Test page: Use this page to select the following
options: </span>
<ol type="a">
<li><span>Select your test facility. You can test the generated proxy
in the Web Service Explorer, or the Universal Test Client.</span></li>

<li><span>Select  <span class="uicontrol">Run test on server</span> to start the
server for you automatically.</span></li>

</ol>

</li>

<li><span>Web Service Publication page: If you have selected to publish your
Web service to a UDDI registry, use this page to launch the Web Services Explorer
and select the UDDI registry to which the Web service will be published. Click
 <span class="uicontrol">Finish</span>.</span></li>

</ol>

<div class="section"><div class="p">After the Web service has been created,
the following may occur depending on the options you selected: <ul>
<li>If you have selected to test the Web service using the Web Services Explorer,
the Explorer will open. Select the operation you want to test, enter the required
information, and click  <strong>Go</strong>. The result will display in the Status pane.</li>

<li>If you have selected to publish the Web service, the Web Services Explorer
is launched displaying the page required to publish your Web service. Follow
the instructions in  <var class="varname">Publishing the Web service</var> to complete

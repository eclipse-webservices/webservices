environment</h1>




<div><p>The Web Service wizard assists you in creating a new Web service,
configuring it for deployment, and deploying the Web service to a server.
Once your Web service is deployed, the wizard assists you in generating the
client proxy and sample application to test the Web service. When you have
completed testing, you can publish your Web service to a UDDI Business Registry
using the Export wizard.</p>

<div class="p"><div class="p">Prerequisites:<ol>
<li id="twsbeana__installaxis2link"><a name="twsbeana__installaxis2link"><!-- --></a>You must have installed the Apache Axis2 runtime

<li>Create or import a bean into the Java™ source folder of the Web project. To
import, select the <strong>Java Resources: src</strong> folder, and from
the file menu select <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Import</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">General</span>

your Web service type, and select the Java bean from which the service will be
created.</span>

<li class="substepexpand"><span>Select the stages of Web services development that you want
to complete using the slider:</span> <ul>
<li>Develop: this will develop the WSDL definition and implementation of the
Web service. This includes such tasks as creating the modules which will contain
the generated code, WSDL files, deployment descriptors, and Java files
when appropriate.</li>

<li>Assemble: this ensures the project that will host the Web service or client
gets associated to an EAR when required by the target application server.</li>

<li>Deploy: this will create the deployment code for the service.</li>

<li>Install: this will install and configure the Web module and EARs on the
target server.</li>

<li>Start: this will start the server once the service has been installed
on it. The server-config.wsdd file will be generated.</li>

<li>Test: this will provide various options for testing the service, such
as using the Web Service Explorer or sample JSPs.</li>

want to deploy your service to a different server click the link to specify
a different server.</span></li>

<li class="substepexpand"><span>Select the service project: the project selected in your workspace
is displayed. To select a different project click on the project link. If
you are deploying to WebSphere<sup>®</sup> Application Server you will also be asked
to select the EAR associated with the project.</span> Ensure that the
project selected as the Client Web Project is different from the Service Web
Project, or the service will be overwritten by the client's generated artifacts.
</li>

<li class="substepexpand"><span>If you want to create a client, select the type of proxy to
be generated and repeat the above steps for the client.</span></li>

<li class="substepexpand"><span>Publish the Web service: this will launch the Web Services Explorer
to publish your Web service to a UDDI registry.</span></li>

<li class="substepexpand"><span>Monitor the Web service: this will send the Web service traffic
through the TCP/IP Monitor, which allows you to watch the SOAP traffic generated
by the Web service and to test this traffic for WS-I compliance. Alternately
you can manually set up a TCP/IP monitor as described in <a href="../../org.eclipse.wst.wsi.ui.doc.user/tasks/tmonitor.html">Using the TCP/IP Monitor to test Web services</a></span></li>

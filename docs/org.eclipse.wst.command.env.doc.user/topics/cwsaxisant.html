<h1 class="topictitle1">Creating Axis runtime environment Web services and clients using Web
services Ant tasks</h1>



<div><p>If you prefer not to use the Web service wizard, you can use Ant
files to create Web services and clients using the Axis runtime environment.
The Web services Ant tasks can be run in two ways: through the Eclipse workspace
using <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Run As</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Ant Build...</span>
</span>, or they can be run headless through the command line. Once
you have created your Web service, you can then deploy it to a server, test
it, and publish it as a business entity or business service.</p>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Prerequisites</h4><p>Before you create a Web service or
client using the Ant tasks, you need to complete a few prerequisites.</p>
<ul>
<li>Install Apache Tomcat, create a server, and create a dynamic Web project
associated with that server as described in <a href="../../org.eclipse.jst.ws.axis.ui.doc.user/tasks/ttomcatserv.html">Creating an Apache Tomcat server and Web project</a></li>

<li>Import the required Ant files into your workspace:<ol>
<li>Create a project.</li>

<li>Import the required Ant files. Select <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">File</span>
 &gt; <span class="uicontrol">New</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Other</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Web Services</span>
 &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Ant Files</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Next</span></span>.</li>

<li>Select the project you created, and click <span class="uicontrol">Finish</span>.</li>

</ol>
Three files will be imported into this project:<ul>
<li>wsgen.xml - this is the Ant file.</li>

<li>axisservice.properties - this is a sample Ant properties file referenced
by the Ant file. You can modify the properties in this file to generate a
Web service.</li>

<li>axisclient.properties - this is a sample Ant properties file referenced
by the Ant file. You can modify the properties in this file to generate a
Web service client.</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li>Create a dynamic Web project for the Web service or client.</li>

</ul>
</div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Creating a Web service or client</h4><p>Once you've completed
the prerequisites you can do the following:</p>

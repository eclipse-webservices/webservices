<h1 class="topictitle1">Publishing Web services and business entities</h1>
<div><p>Through UDDI and WSIL, other applications can discover WSDL documents
and bind with them to execute transactions or perform other business processes. </p>
<div class="section"><p>UDDI enables the discovery of Web services by providing a distributed
registry of businesses and their service descriptions, implemented in a common
XML format.  In order for a service requestor to discover a service,
a service provider must first publish a business entity and at least one business
service, and service interface in a UDDI registry.  The Web Services
Explorer is a Web application that supports the publication, discovery, and
maintenance of business entities, business services, and service interfaces.</p>
<p>WSIL
enables the discovery of Web services by defining a distributed service discovery
method that supplies references to service descriptions at the service provider's
point-of-offering, by specifying how to inspect a Web site for available Web
services.  The WSIL specification defines the locations on a Web site
where you can look for Web service descriptions. Since WSIL focuses on
distributed service discovery, the WSIL specification complements UDDI by
facilitating the discovery of services that are available on Web sites
that may not be listed yet in a UDDI registry. The Web Services Explorer allows
you to generate and explore WSIL documents.</p>
<p>The favorites page of the
Web Services Explorer allows you to store the location of UDDI registries,
business entities, Web services, service interfaces, as well as WSIL and WSDL
documents.</p>
<p>Use the Web Services Explorer to do any of the following
tasks:</p>
<ul><li> <a href="taddreg.html">Add a registry to the Web Services Explorer</a> </li>
<li> <a href="tbkmrk.html">Adding a registry, business entity, business
service, service interface, WSIL, or WSDL service to Favorites</a> </li>
<li> <a href="tdiscov.html">Discover a Web service</a> </li>
<li> <a href="tpubent.html">Publish a business entity to a registry</a> </li>
<li> <a href="tpublish.html">Publish a business service to a registry</a> </li>
<li> <a href="tunpub.html">Remove a business entity, business service,
or service interface from a registry</a> </li>
<li> <a href="tupdate.html">Update a business entity, business service,
or service interface</a> </li>
<li> <a href="tbusproj.html">Manage referenced services</a> </li>
<li> <a href="tassert.html">Manage publisher assertions</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>Prerequisites:</p>
</div>
<ol><li class="stepexpand"><span>Before you can use the Web Services Explorer to perform any of
these functions, you must  <a href="treg.html">register with a public registry</a> or <a href="../../org.eclipse.jst.ws.uddi.registry.doc.user/tasks/tuddiwiz.html"> configure a private registry</a>.  There are many different
registries with which you can register.</span> </li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Ensure that you are using a supported Web browser.</span> The
following Web browsers and versions are supported:<ul><li>Internet Explorer: 6.0 and up</li>
<li>Mozilla: 1.2.1 and up</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span> <a href="tstrtexp.html">Launch the Web Services Explorer</a>.</span></li>
</ol>
<div class="section"><div class="p"><strong>Known limitations of the Web Services Explorer:</strong><ul><li>The taxonomy categories in the Web Services Explorer are not translated
since they must match those in the standards adhered to by UDDI (ISO, UNSPSC
7.3, NAICS).</li>
<li>The Web Services Explorer will launch without the browser toolbar which
shows, amongst other things, the URL to the Web application. This URL should
only be used by users with accessibility needs. The URL to the Web Services
Explorer Web application can be obtained through the following steps:<ol><li>From the Window menu, select Preferences.</li>
<li>In the Preferences dialog, select <span class="uicontrol">Web Browser</span> in
the left pane.</li>
<li>On the right, select <span class="uicontrol">Use external Web Browser</span>.</li>
<li>In the <span class="uicontrol">Location: text</span> field, browse or type in
the full path of the Internet Explorer executable. (for example, C:\Program
Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe).</li>
<li>Click <span class="uicontrol">Apply</span> followed by <span class="uicontrol">OK</span>.</li>
</ol>
 Note that this preference will now apply to any browser windows that
are launched by the user or by the tools themselves (such as the Universal
Test Client).  The Web Services Explorer will now launch in an external browser
and its URL should be in the Address field. This can then be pasted or opened
using am accessibility assisting browser such as IBM<sup>®</sup> Home Page Reader.</li>
<li>When performing an advanced find or publish in the UDDI page of the Web
Services Explorer, the items in the drop down list for picking a language
in conjunction with a name or description is sorted  according to the operating
system's locale settings. On Windows<sup>®</sup>, this order may be managed through
the Control Panel. To do this:<ol><li>Open the Control Panel.</li>
<li>Launch the Regional Options control panel applet.</li>
<li>In the General tab of the resulting dialog, there may be a "Sorting order"
drop-down list. If so, pick a sorting order and then click <span class="uicontrol">Apply</span> followed
by <span class="uicontrol">OK</span>.</li>
<li>In the Web Services Explorer, the new sorting order comes into effect
once the page reloads. This can be accomplished by pressing the back arrow
followed by the forward arrow in the main toolbar.</li>
</ol>
Note: The instructions above apply to Windows 2000. On Windows XP,
the tab mentioned in step 3 is called "Regional Options". Beside the language
drop-down, there is a <span class="uicontrol">Customize</span> button. When this is
clicked, a new dialog appears. A sorting tab will allow users to pick the
sorting method if applicable.</li>

<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../tasks/tstrtexp.html">Launching the Web Services Explorer</a></strong><br />
The Web services tools allows you to launch the Web Services Explorer
in several ways.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../tasks/treg.html">Registering with a UDDI registry</a></strong><br />
In order to publish your business entity and Web service to a UDDI
registry, you must first register with the registry that you want to use.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../tasks/taddreg.html">Adding a Registry to the IBM Web Services Explorer</a></strong><br />
Although the Web Services Explorer comes populated with several
registries, you can also add additional registries to your list of favorites.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../tasks/tpubent.html">Publishing a business entity</a></strong><br />
A business entity contains information about the business that
has published a service.  Before you can publish a business service,
you must publish a business entity.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../tasks/tpublish.html">Publishing a Web service</a></strong><br />
The Web service, also known as the business service, describes
a Web service's endpoint and where its WSDL file resides. The WSDL file lists
the operations that service provides.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../tasks/tupdate.html">Updating a business entity, Web service, or service interface</a></strong><br />
After you have published a business entity, Web service, or service
interface, you can update it through the Web Services Explorer.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../tasks/tunpub.html">Removing a business entity, Web service, or service interface from a registry</a></strong><br />
After you have published a business entity, Web service, or service
interface, you can remove or unpublish it through the Web Services Explorer.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../tasks/tbusproj.html">Managing referenced services</a></strong><br />
A service projection enables a business entity to reference a service
that was published by another business entity. By using the businessService
structure as a projection to an already published businessService, businesses
can share or reuse services.  Service projections are managed centrally
as part of the referencing businessEntity.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../tasks/tassert.html">Managing publisher assertions</a></strong><br />
A publisher assertion is a way in UDDI to associate businessEntity
structures.  The publisher assertion defines a group of businessEntity
structures. Many businesses are not effectively represented by a single businessEntity.
A publisher assertion allows for associations to be formed between several
businessEntity structures. For example, a large company may have several subsidiaries
that have different descriptions but are still closely coupled and want to
make their relationships visible in UDDI registries.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../tasks/tbkmrk.html">Adding a registry, business entity, business service, service interface, WSIL, or WSDL service to Favorites</a></strong><br />
</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../tasks/tgenwsil.html">Generating a WSIL file</a></strong><br />
Web Services Inspection Language (WSIL) is a service discovery
mechanism that is an alternative to UDDI as well as complementary to UDDI.
WSIL can be generated at any point in the Web service development cycle once
the WSDL file for the Web service has been created.</li>

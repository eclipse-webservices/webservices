<h1 class="topictitle1">Managing publisher assertions</h1>



<div><p>A publisher assertion is a way in UDDI to associate businessEntity
structures.  The publisher assertion defines a group of businessEntity
structures. Many businesses are not effectively represented by a single businessEntity.
A publisher assertion allows for associations to be formed between several
businessEntity structures. For example, a large company may have several subsidiaries
that have different descriptions but are still closely coupled and want to
make their relationships visible in UDDI registries.</p>

<div class="p">Prerequisites:<ol>
<li><a href="treg.html">Register with a registry</a></li>

<li><a href="tstrtexp.html">Launch the Web Services Explorer</a></li>

<li><a href="taddreg.html">Add the registry to the Web Services Explorer</a></li>

</ol>
</div>

<div class="section"><p>For more information on publisher assertions, refer to the  <a href="http://www.uddi.org/specification.html" target="_blank">UDDI Version 2.0 Programmer's API Specification</a> and the  <a href="http://www.uddi.org/specification.html" target="_blank">UDDI Version 2.0 Data Structure Specification</a>.</p>
<p>To
manage publisher assertions, do the following:</p>
</div>

<ol>
<li><span>In the Navigator pane, select the business entity for which you
want to manage referenced businesses.</span></li>

<li><span>In the Actions pane toolbar, click the  <span class="uicontrol">Manage Publisher
Assertions</span> icon  <img src="../images/busasst.gif" alt="Picture of the Manage Publisher Assertions icon." />.</span></li>

<li><span>On the Manage Publisher Assertions page you can add, remove, and
maintain relationships with other business entities.</span></li>

</ol>

<div class="section"><p> <span class="uicontrol">Important:</span> A business entity that is referenced
by another business entity must in turn reference that business entity in
order to make the publisher assertion public. A one-way reference is considered
an incomplete publisher assertion and is visible only to the owner of the
business entity.</p>

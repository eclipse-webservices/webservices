<h1 class="topictitle1">Managing referenced services</h1>
<div><p>A service projection enables a business entity to reference a service
that was published by another business entity. By using the businessService
structure as a projection to an already published businessService, businesses
can share or reuse services.  Service projections are managed centrally
as part of the referencing businessEntity.</p>

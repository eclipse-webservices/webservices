<context><p>UDDI enables the discovery of Web services by providing
a distributed registry of businesses and their service descriptions,
implemented in a common XML format.&nbsp; In order for a service requestor
to discover a service, a service provider must first publish a business
entity and at least one business service, and service interface in
a UDDI registry.&nbsp; The Web Services Explorer is a Web application
that supports the publication, discovery, and maintenance of business
entities, business services, and service interfaces.</p><p>WSIL enables
the discovery of Web services by defining a distributed service discovery
method that supplies references to service descriptions at the service
provider's point-of-offering, by specifying how to inspect a Web site
for available Web services.&nbsp; The WSIL specification defines the
locations on a Web site where you can look for Web service descriptions.&nbsp;Since
WSIL focuses on distributed service discovery, the WSIL specification
complements UDDI by facilitating the discovery of services that are
available on Web sites that may not be listed yet in a UDDI registry.
The Web Services Explorer allows you to generate and explore WSIL
documents.</p><p>The favorites page of the Web Services Explorer allows
you to store the location of UDDI registries, business entities, Web
services, service interfaces, as well as WSIL and WSDL documents.</p><p>Use
the Web Services Explorer to do any of the following tasks:</p><ul>
<li> <xref href="taddreg.dita">Add a registry to the Web Services
Explorer</xref> </li>
<li> <xref href="tbkmrk.dita">Adding a registry, business entity,
business service, service interface, WSIL, or WSDL service to Favorites</xref> </li>
<li><xref href="tlogexp.dita"></xref></li>
<li> <xref href="tdiscov.dita">Discover a Web service</xref> </li>
<li> <xref href="tpubent.dita">Publish a business entity to a registry</xref> </li>
<li> <xref href="tpublish.dita">Publish a business service to a registry</xref> </li>
<li> <xref href="tunpub.dita">Remove a business entity, business service,
or service interface from a registry</xref> </li>
<li> <xref href="tupdate.dita">Update a business entity, business
service, or service interface</xref> </li>
<li> <xref href="tbusproj.dita">Manage referenced services</xref> </li>
<li> <xref href="tassert.dita">Manage publisher assertions</xref> </li>
</ul><p>Prerequisites:</p></context>
<steps>
<step><cmd></cmd></step>
<step><cmd>Before you can use the Web Services Explorer to perform
any of these functions, you must  <xref href="treg.dita">register
with a public registry</xref> or have access to a private registry.
There are many different registries with which you can register.</cmd>
<info>If you are publishing to a private registry on WebSphere Application
Server, the server must be started.</info></step>
<step><cmd>Ensure that you are using a supported Web browser.</cmd>
<info>The following Web browsers and versions are supported:<ul>
<li>Internet Explorer: 6.0 and up</li>
<li>Mozilla: 1.2.1 and up</li>
</ul></info></step>
<step><cmd> <xref href="tstrtexp.dita">Launch the Web Services Explorer</xref>.</cmd>
</step>
</steps>
<result><p><b>Known limitations of the Web Services Explorer:</b><ul>
<li>The taxonomy categories in the Web Services Explorer are not translated
since they must match those in the standards adhered to by UDDI (ISO,
UNSPSC 7.3, NAICS).</li>
<li>The Web Services Explorer will launch without the browser toolbar
which shows, amongst other things, the URL to the Web application.
This URL should only be used by users with accessibility needs. The
URL to the Web Services Explorer Web application can be obtained through
the following steps:<ol>
<li>From the Window menu, select Preferences.</li>
<li>In the Preferences dialog, select <uicontrol>Web Browser</uicontrol> in
the left pane.</li>
<li>On the right, select <uicontrol>Use external Web Browser</uicontrol>.</li>
<li>In the <uicontrol>Location: text</uicontrol> field, browse or
type in the full path of the Internet Explorer executable. (for example,
C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe).</li>
<li>Click <uicontrol>Apply</uicontrol> followed by <uicontrol>OK</uicontrol>.</li>
</ol> Note that this preference will now apply to any browser windows
that are launched by the user or by the tools themselves (such as
the Universal Test Client).  The Web Services Explorer will now launch
in an external browser and its URL should be in the Address field.
This can then be pasted or opened using am accessibility assisting
browser.</li>
<li>When performing an advanced find or publish in the UDDI page of
the Web Services Explorer, the items in the drop down list for picking
a language in conjunction with a name or description is sorted  according
to the operating system's locale settings. On <tm tmclass="special"
tmowner="Microsoft Corporation" tmtype="reg" trademark="Windows">Windows</tm>,
this order may be managed through the Control Panel. To do this:<ol>
<li>Open the Control Panel.</li>
<li>Launch the Regional Options control panel applet.</li>
<li>In the General tab of the resulting dialog, there may be a "Sorting
order" drop-down list. If so, pick a sorting order and then click <uicontrol>Apply</uicontrol> followed
by <uicontrol>OK</uicontrol>.</li>
<li>In the Web Services Explorer, the new sorting order comes into
effect once the page reloads. This can be accomplished by pressing
the back arrow followed by the forward arrow in the main toolbar.</li>
</ol>Note: The instructions above apply to <tm tmclass="special"
tmowner="Microsoft Corporation" tmtype="reg" trademark="Windows">Windows</tm> 2000.
On <tm tmclass="special" tmowner="Microsoft Corporation" tmtype="reg"
trademark="Windows">Windows</tm> XP, the tab mentioned in step 3 is
called "Regional Options". Beside the language drop-down, there is
a <uicontrol>Customize</uicontrol> button. When this is clicked, a
new dialog appears. A sorting tab will allow users to pick the sorting
method if applicable.</li>

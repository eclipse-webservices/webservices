<h1 class="topictitle1">Generating a WSIL file</h1>
<div><p>Web Services Inspection Language (WSIL) is a service discovery
mechanism that is an alternative to UDDI as well as complementary to UDDI.
WSIL can be generated at any point in the Web service development cycle once
the WSDL file for the Web service has been created.</p>
<div class="p"><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> In order to generate a WSIL file, you need to
know the URL to a WSDL file.</div>
<div class="section"><p>WSIL helps synchronize this process by maintaining references
to WSDL URLs. Web services tools that process WSDL documents - such as the
Web Service Client and Creation wizards - will accept a WSIL document as a
substitute for WSDL. This allows you to create a standardized WSDL reference
(WSIL) document in your project during Web service client generation, then
at a later time easily regenerate the client from that reference document.
No copies of the WSDL or WSDL URLs are required.</p>
<p>You can generate a
WSIL file from a pre-existing WSDL file or during Web service creation or
consumption.</p>

a WSIL file.</span></li>
<li><span>From the  <strong>File</strong> menu, select  <strong>Import</strong> &gt;  <strong>WSIL &gt;
Next</strong>. The WSIL Import window opens.</span></li>
<li><span>If you have selected to perform step 1, the WSIL URI field should
be prefilled with the name of your WSDL file, where the extension has been
changed from  <tt class="sysout">.wsdl</tt> to  <tt class="sysout">.wsil</tt>.
The WSDL section should contain the URLs to the selected WSDL files. You can
also enter additional WSDL URLs. Alternately, you can browse to the location
of a WSIL file, or manually enter the location of the WSIL and WSDL files
in the appropriate locations.</span></li>
<li><span>Click Finish. A WSIL file will be generated in the specified location.</span></li>

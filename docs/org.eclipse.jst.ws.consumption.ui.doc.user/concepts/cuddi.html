<h1 class="topictitle1">Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI)</h1>
<div><p>Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI) specification
defines a way to publish and discover information about Web services.</p>
<div class="p">UDDI has two functions: <ul><li>It is a SOAP-based protocol that defines how clients communicate with
UDDI registries.</li>
<li>It is a particular set of global replicated registries.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>UDDI includes an XML schema for SOAP messages that defines a set of documents
to describe business and services information, a common set of APIs for querying
and publishing information to the directories, and an API for replicating
directory entries between peer UDDI nodes.</p>
<p>For more information on UDDI refer to  <a href="http://www.uddi.org" target="_blank">www.uddi.org</a></p>
<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">UDDI registries</h4><p>UDDI manages the discovery of Web
services by relying on a distributed registry of businesses and their service
descriptions implemented in a common XML format. Before you can publish your
business entity and Web service to a public registry, you must first register
your business entity with a UDDI registry.</p>
<p>UDDI registries come in two
forms: public and private.  Both types comply to the same specifications. 
A private registry enables you to publish and test your internal e-business
applications in a secure, private environment.  Rational<sup>®</sup> Developer
products include a private UDDI registry. </p>
<p>A public registry is
a collection of peer directories that contain information about businesses
and services. It locates services that are registered at one of its peer nodes
and facilitates the discovery of published Web services. Data is replicated
at each of the registries on a regular basis. This ensures consistency in
service description formats and makes it easy to track changes as they occur. IBM<sup>®</sup> maintains
two public registries called the IBM UDDI Business Registry and the IBM UDDI Test
Registry. The IBM UDDI
Test Registry allows you to develop your Web service and experience the UDDI
registration process without placing your Web service in an official registry. 
Use the IBM UDDI
Test Registry to experiment with UDDI, and to test and validate your Web service. 
For more information on the IBM's public registries, refer to  <a href="http://uddi.ibm.com" target="_blank">http://uddi.ibm.com</a> For
a list of public registries, refer to  <a href="http://www.uddi.org/register.html" target="_blank">http://www.uddi.org/register.html</a></p>
<p>A private
registry allows you to publish and test your internal applications in a secure,
private environment. IBM has developed a private registry called the IBM WebSphere<sup>®</sup> UDDI
Registry.  The IBM WebSphere UDDI Registry is a persistent storage
mechanism for information published in the Registry.  There are two implementations
of the SOAP-based APIs - the WebSphere Studio version 5.0 and 5.1 registries
based on UDDI v2 and the Rational Developer products' registry based on UDDI
v3 - that allow programmatic publish and inquiry operations. The private registry
supports access using JDBC 2. Access using JDBC 1 is not supported. The IBM private
registry and the Web Services Explorer support user-defined custom taxonomies
in addition to the standard NAICS, UNSPSC and ISO-3166 taxonomies.</p>
<p>The
UDDI Business Registry acts as a B2B directory linking marketplaces, buyers,
and sellers. The information provided in the registry consists of three components:
white pages, yellow pages, and green pages. White pages include the business
name, contact information, and a text description of the business's services.
Yellow pages include industrial categorizations based on standard taxonomies
such as NAICS, ISO 3166, and UNSPSC. Green pages include references to specifications
for Web services and pointers to various file and URL-based discovery mechanisms.
This makes it easy for businesses to integrate across marketplaces. Because
it is registered, information is made available across all applications. For
more information on NAICS refer to  <a href="http://www.naics.com" target="_blank">www.naics.com</a> For more information on UNSPSC refer
to  <a href="http://www.unspsc.org" target="_blank">www.unspsc.org</a> For
more information on ISO 3166 refer to  <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/en/prods-services/iso3166ma/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.iso.org/iso/en/prods-services/iso3166ma/index.html</a></p>
<p>Businesses
populate the registry with descriptions of the services that they support.
UDDI assigns a unique identifier to each service description and business
registration. These become the service and business keys respectively. Search
engines, and applications query the registry to discover services. UDDI servers
are a directory of available services and service providers.</p>

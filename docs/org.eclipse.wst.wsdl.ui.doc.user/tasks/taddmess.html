<h1 class="topictitle1">Adding a message</h1>
<div><p>Messages represent an abstract definition of the data being transmitted.
A message consists of logical parts, each of which is associated with a definition
within some type system. WSDL messages are top level objects that can be referenced
by an operation's input, output and fault elements (within a port type).</p>
<div class="section"><p>If you want to create a new message for your input, output, or
fault element, follow these steps:  </p>
</div>
<ol><li class="stepexpand"><span>In the Graph view, right-click your input, output, or fault element
and click  <strong>Set Message.</strong></span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Select the  <strong>Create a new message</strong> radio button.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Type the name of the message in dialog.</span> This name should
be a unique amongst all messages defined within the enclosing WSDL document.
Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>The new message will appear in the graph view within the messages
section.</span> An line should be visible connecting the input, output
or fault with the message.</li>
</ol>
<div class="section"><p> <strong>Note</strong>: Messages are referenced within a port type (specifically
by an operation's input, output and fault objects). The input, output and
fault objects within a binding do not reference messages. Hence you cannot
create a new message by right clicking on a input, output, or fault within
a binding (these are also known as binding input, binding output and binding
faults).</p>
<p> <strong>Tip</strong>: You can also create a new message for your input,
output, or fault element using the Outline view. Under the  <strong>Port Types</strong> 
folder, right-click your element and click  <strong>Set Message &gt; Create a new
message</strong>. Your message will appear in the Outline view under the  <strong>Messages</strong> folder. </p>
<p>If
you want to reuse a message for your input, output, or fault element, follow
these steps:  </p>
<ol><li>In the Graph view, right-click your input, output, or fault element and
click  <strong>Set Message.</strong></li>
<li>Press the  <span class="uicontrol">Select an existing message</span> radio button.</li>
<li>The existing messages will be listed. Select one and click  <strong>Finish</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to import an existing message for your input, output,
or fault element, follow these steps:</p>
<ol><li>In the Graph view, right-click your input, output, or fault element and
click  <strong>Set Message.</strong></li>
<li>Select the  <strong>Import message from a file</strong> check box. Click  <strong>Browse</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the file that contains the message you want to use. Click  <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
<li>The messages in the file will be listed. Select one and click  <strong>Finish</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can now add parts to your message. Parts are a flexible mechanism
for describing the logical abstract content of a message.</p>

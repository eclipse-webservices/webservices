<h1 class="topictitle1">Adding a port to a service</h1>



<div><p>A port defines an individual endpoint by specifying a single address
for a binding. The port contains a 'binding' attribute that references a binding
and an address element that provides a specification for the endpoint.</p>

<div class="section"><p>Services are used to group sets of related ports together. Ports
within a service have the following relationship:</p>
<ul>
<li>None of the ports communicate with each other (for example, the output
of one port is not the input of another).</li>

<li>If a service has several ports that share a port type, but employ different
bindings or addresses, the ports are alternatives. Each port provides semantically
equivalent behavior (within the transport and message format limitations imposed
by each binding).</li>

<li>You can determine a service's port types by examining its ports. Using
this information a user can determine if a given machine supports all the
operations needed to complete a given task.</li>

</ul>
<p>To add a port to a service, follow these steps:</p>
</div>

<ol>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>In the Design view, right-click the service you want to add a port
to, then click <strong>Add Port.</strong> To select the new port, click the port in
the service object.</span></li>

<li class="stepexpand"><span>In the Properties view, click the <strong>General</strong> pane. In the <strong>Name</strong> field,
type the name of the port.</span> The name of the port should provide
it with a unique name amongst all the ports defined within the service.
</li>

<li class="stepexpand"><span>A <strong>Binding</strong> defines the message format and protocol details
for operations and messages defined by a particular port type.</span> You
can create a new binding for your port, re-use an existing one, or import
one. Refer to the related tasks for more details.</li>

<li class="stepexpand"><span>In the <strong>Address</strong> field, type the address of the port.</span>
</li>

<li class="stepexpand"><span>Type any information about the port you want the user to read in
the <strong>Documentation</strong> pane.</span></li>

<li class="stepexpand"><span>To manage extensions, click the <strong>Extensibility</strong> pane. You
can either add, sort, or remove extensions. </span>
</li>

</ol>

<div class="section"><p> <strong>Tip</strong>: You can also create a port using the Outline view
by right-clicking your service under the <strong>Services</strong> folder and clicking <strong>Add
Port</strong>. Your port (regardless of which view you create it in) will appear
in both the Design view and the Outline view.</p>

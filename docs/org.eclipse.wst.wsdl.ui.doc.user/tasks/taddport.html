<h1 class="topictitle1">Adding a port to a service</h1>
<div><p>A port defines an individual endpoint by specifying a single address
for a binding. The port contains a 'binding' attribute that references a binding
and an address element that provides a specification for the endpoint.</p>
<div class="section"><p>Services are used to group sets of related ports together. Ports
within a service have the following relationship:</p>
<ul><li>None of the ports communicate with each other (for example, the output
of one port is not the input of another).</li>
<li>If a service has several ports that share a port type, but employ different
bindings or addresses, the ports are alternatives. Each port provides semantically
equivalent behavior (within the transport and message format limitations imposed
by each binding). </li>
<li>You can determine a service's port types by examining its ports. Using
this information a user can determine if a given machine supports all the
operations needed to complete a given task.</li>
</ul>
<p>To add a port to a service, follow these steps:</p>
</div>
<ol><li class="stepexpand"><span>In the Graph view, right-click the service you want to add a port
to, then click  <strong>Add Child &gt; Port.</strong></span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Type the name of the port in the dialog.</span> Click <strong>Finish</strong>.
The name of the port should provide it with a unique name amongst all the
ports defined within the service.</li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>A  <strong>Binding</strong> defines the message format and protocol details
for operations and messages defined by a particular port type.</span> You
can either create a new binding for your port, re-use an existing one, or
import one. Refer to the related tasks for more details.</li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Type any information about the port you want the user to read in
the  <strong>Documentation</strong> field.</span></li>
</ol>
<div class="section"><p> <strong>Tip</strong>: You can also create a port using the Outline view
by right-clicking your service under the  <strong>Services</strong> folder and clicking
 <strong>Add Child &gt; Port</strong>. Your port (regardless of which view you create it
in) will appear in both the Graph view and the Outline view.</p>

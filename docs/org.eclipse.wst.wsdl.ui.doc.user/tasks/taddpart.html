<h1 class="topictitle1">Adding a part to a message</h1>
<div><p>All messages contain one or more parts. Parts are a flexible mechanism
for describing the logical abstract content of a message. The message definition
associates each part with a type using a message-typing attribute.</p>
<div class="section"><p>To add a part to a message, follow these steps:</p>
</div>
<ol><li class="stepexpand"><span>In Graph view, select the message you want to add a part to.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Right-click the message and click  <strong>Add Child &gt; Part</strong>.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Type the name of the part in the dialog.</span> Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Your part can refer to either a <strong>type</strong> or an <strong>element</strong>.</span> Select the appropriate option from the <strong>Reference Kind</strong> list.</li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>If you selected  <strong>type</strong> in the <strong>Reference Kind</strong> list,
you now have the option of selecting an XML schema data type from the <strong>Type</strong> drop
down list. The list of types comes from any available referenced XML schemas.</span> </li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>If you selected <strong>element</strong> in the <strong>Reference Kind</strong> list,
you now have the option of selecting an XML schema element from
the  <strong>Element</strong> drop down list. The list of elements comes from any
available referenced XML schemas.</span> </li>
</ol>
<div class="section"><p> <strong>Tip</strong>: You can also create a new part for your message using
the Outline view. Under the  <strong>Messages</strong> folder, right-click your element
and click  <strong>Add Child &gt; Part</strong>. Your part will automatically appear in
the Outline view (under the  <strong>Messages</strong> folder), but it will only appear
in the Graph view if the message you added it to currently does.</p>

<h1 class="topictitle1">Editing WSDL files</h1>
<div><p>Once you have created a WSDL file, you can edit it in the WSDL
editor. You can also import WSDL files you have created in other
products into the workbench and edit them in the WSDL editor.</p>
<div class="section"><p>To open a WSDL file in the WSDL editor, double-click it in the
Navigator view or right-click it and click  <strong>Open With &gt; WSDL Editor.</strong></p>
</div>

<ul class="ullinks">
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../tasks/taddsrvc.html">Adding a service</a></strong><br />
The  <tt class="sysout">service</tt> element is a collection
of related ports and specifies the location of the service.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../tasks/taddport.html">Adding a port to a service</a></strong><br />
A port defines an individual endpoint by specifying a single address
for a binding. The port contains a 'binding' attribute that references a binding
and an address element that provides a specification for the endpoint.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../tasks/tsetprtt.html">Setting a port type</a></strong><br />
A port type is a named set of abstract operations and the abstract
messages involved. Each operation refers to an input message and output messages.
A port type is reference by a binding object. Each binding references exactly
one port type. Since each port refers to exactly one binding, each port has
exactly one port type.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../tasks/tsetbind.html">Setting a binding</a></strong><br />
A binding is a top level WSDL object that provides a concrete specification
regarding the transmission of messages to and from a web service. A binding
references exactly one port type. The structure of a binding corresponds very
closely to that of the port type. The binding contains extensibility elements
(for example, soap, http, and mime) that specify protocol specific details.
Each port within a service references exactly one binding.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../tasks/taddoper.html">Adding an operation</a></strong><br />
An operation names the operation and lists the expected inputs
and outputs. The operation element may also contain a fault sub-element that
describes any error data the operation may return.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../tasks/taddmess.html">Adding a message</a></strong><br />
Messages represent an abstract definition of the data being transmitted.
A message consists of logical parts, each of which is associated with a definition
within some type system. WSDL messages are top level objects that can be referenced
by an operation's input, output and fault elements (within a port type).</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../tasks/taddpart.html">Adding a part to a message</a></strong><br />
All messages contain one or more parts. Parts are a flexible mechanism
for describing the logical abstract content of a message. The message definition
associates each part with a type using a message-typing attribute.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../tasks/tcrtimpt.html">Creating an import statement</a></strong><br />
The import statement is used to import other WSDL documents or
XML schemas into your WSDL document. This enables you to have more modular
WSDL documents. The use of the  <strong>import</strong> statement allows the separation
of the different elements of a service definition into independent documents,
which can then be imported as needed. This technique helps in writing clearer
service definitions, by separating the definitions according to their level
of abstraction.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../tasks/tcrttype.html">Creating a new type for your WSDL file</a></strong><br />
Types describe all the data types used between the client and server.
WSDL is not tied exclusively to a specific typing system, but it uses the
W3C XML Schema specification as its default choice.</li>

<div><div class="section"><p>The Graph view provides a graphical way to browse and edit your
WSDL file. Each type of top level wsdl object is shown within a group (e.g.
service, port type, message). Within each group is a tree view that can be
used to browse the structure of the object. The service, binding, port type
and message groups are 'linked'. If for example we select an input in the
port types, we'll notice that the message that is referenced by this message
is scrolled into view in the messages group. A line displays to denote a reference
(or association) between these objects.</p>

binding button at the top left of the Graph View to hide the bindings. With
the bindings hidden a service can be browsed from a purely abstract level

concrete details represented by the binding, select the show/hide binding
button again to make them visible.</div>

<p>The
Outline view contains the following folders you can use (by right-clicking

<ul><li> <strong>Imports</strong> statements, which are used to associate a namespace
with a document location.</li>
<li> <strong>Types</strong>, which provide data type definitions used to describe the
messages exchanged.  You cannot edit any types directly using this folder.</li>
<li> <strong>Messages</strong>, which represent an abstract definition of the data being
transmitted. A message consists of logical parts, each of which is associated
with a definition within some type system.</li>
<li> <strong>Port Types</strong>, which are a set of abstract operations. Each operation
refers to an input message and output messages.</li>
<li> <strong>Bindings</strong>, which specify concrete protocol and data format specifications
for the operations and messages defined by a particular port type.</li>
<li> <strong>Services</strong>, which are used to aggregate a set of related ports <img src="../images/show-hide-binding.gif" alt="" /> </li>

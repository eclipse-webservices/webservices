<h1 class="topictitle1">Editing WSDL files with the WSDL Editor</h1>



<div><p>The WSDL editor allows you to easily and graphically create, modify,
view, and validate WSDL files.</p>

<p>Using the WSDL editor, you can do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create new WSDL files</li>

<li>Validate and edit WSDL files</li>

<li>Create and delete:  <ul>
<li>services, which are used to aggregate a set of related ports. These are
the root elements of all WSDL files.</li>

<li>ports, which specify an address for a binding, thus defining a single
communication endpoint.</li>

<li>bindings, which specify concrete protocol and data format specifications
for the operations and messages defined by a particular port type.</li>

<li>port types, which are a set of abstract operations. Each operation refers
to an input message and output messages.</li>

<li>operations, which refer to input and output messages</li>

<li>messages, which represent an abstract definition of the data being transmitted.
A message consists of logical parts, each of which is associated with a definition
within some type system.</li>

<li>parts, which are a flexible mechanism for describing the logical abstract
content of a message</li>

<li>types, which describe all the data types used between the client and server.
WSDL is not tied exclusively to a specific typing system, but it uses the
W3C XML Schema specification as its default choice.</li>

<li>import statements, which are used to associate a namespace with a document
location </li>

</ul>
</li>

<li>Import existing WSDL files for structured viewing</li>

<li>Generate documentation from a WSDL document.</li>

</ul>

<p>The WSDL support in the WSDL editor is based on the W3C <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl" target="_blank">Web Services Description Language (WSDL) 1.1</a>. The WSDL specification from the W3C Web site is
also used for validation.Â  </p>

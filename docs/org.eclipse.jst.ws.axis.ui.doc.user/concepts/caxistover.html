<h1 class="topictitle1">Creating Web services with the Apache Axis run-time environment</h1>
<div><p>This run-time environment is for users who prefer to develop for
the open Apache Axis platform. It is for non-production use only. Axis is
the third generation of the Apache SOAP implementation.  It evolved from
Apache SOAP (which began at IBM<sup>®</sup> as SOAP4J) to make the SOAP engine more flexible,
configurable, and able to handle both SOAP and the upcoming XML Protocol specification
from the W3C open-source effort.</p>
<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Overview</h4><p>Axis is based on JSR 101 Java™ APIs
for XML based RPC (also known as JAX-RPC).  JSR 101 provides a single
interface to any XML-based RPC mechanism, including SOAP.</p>
<p>Web services
application server uses Axis within a servlet to process the incoming message,
extract information from the message headers, and payloads, as well as conforming
to the particular RPC semantics. </p>
<p>The level of Axis currently supported
by Rational Developer products is 1.0.  For more information on Axis,
refer to  <a href="http://xml.apache.org/axis" target="_blank">http://xml.apache.org/axis</a>.
The User's Guide available on this site provides more in-depth information
about using Web services with Apache Axis. The Reading Guide lists several
documents to further your understanding of Axis.</p>
<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The support for
Axis in Rational Developer products is limited to validation that the application
is invoking the Axis emitters correctly. Support for other Axis issues should
be directed to <a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis" target="_blank">http://ws.apache.org/axis</a></div>

The Web Service wizard assists you in creating a new Web service,
configuring it for deployment, and deploying the Web service to a server.
Once your Web service is deployed, the wizard assists you in generating the
client proxy and sample application to test the Web service. When you have
completed testing, you can publish your Web service to a UDDI Business Registry
using the Export wizard.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../tasks/tsklwsdla.html">Creating a Java bean skeleton from a WSDL document using the Apache Axis run-time environment</a></strong><br />
The Web service wizard assists you in creating a skeleton bean
from an existing WSDL document. The skeleton bean contains a set of methods
that correspond to the operations described in the WSDL document. When the
bean is created, each method has a trivial implementation that you replace
by editing the bean.</li>

The Web Service Client wizard assists you in generating a Java bean
proxy and a sample application. The sample Web application demonstrates how
to code a proxy file.</li>

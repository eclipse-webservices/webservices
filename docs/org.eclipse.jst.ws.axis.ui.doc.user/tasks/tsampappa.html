<h1 class="topictitle1">Generating a Java client proxy and a sample application
from a WSDL document using the Axis run-time environment</h1>




<div><p>The Web Service Client wizard assists you in generating a Java™ bean
proxy and a sample application. The sample Web application demonstrates how
to code a proxy file.</p>

<div class="p"><p>Prerequisites:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you are using the Apache Jakarta Tomcat servlet
container as your server, you must install it, configure an instance of it,
and create a Web project targeted to it as described in <a href="ttomcatserv.html">Creating an Apache Tomcat server and Web project</a></li>

<li>Discover and import a WSDL document into the Web project. You can only
use a WSDL file that contains a service element.</li>

</ol>
</div>

<div class="section">To generate a Java client proxy and a sample application
from a discovered WSDL document:</div>

<ol>
<li><span>Switch to the J2EE perspective (<span class="uicontrol">Window &gt; Open Perspective
&gt; J2EE</span>).</span></li>

<li><span>In the Navigator view, select the Web project in which you want
to generate a sample application.</span></li>

<li><span>Click  <span class="uicontrol">File &gt; New &gt; Other</span>. Select  <span class="uicontrol">Web
Services</span> in order to display the various Web service wizards.
Select the  <span class="uicontrol">Web Service Client</span> wizard. Click  <span class="uicontrol">Next</span>.</span>
</li>

<li><span>Web Services page: </span>
<ol type="a">
<li class="substepexpand"><span>Enter the URI to the WSDL, WSIL, or HTML file that will be used
to generate the client.</span></li>

<li class="substepexpand"><span>Select the type of proxy to be generated</span></li>

<li class="substepexpand"><span>Select the stages of Web services development that you want
to complete using the slider:</span> <ul>
<li>Develop: this will develop the WSDL definition and implementation of the
Web service. This includes such tasks as creating the modules which will contain
the generated code and Java files, as well as copying the Axis JARs..</li>

<li>Assemble: this ensures the project that will host the Web service or client
gets associated to an EAR when required by the target application server.</li>

<li>Deploy: this will create the deployment code for the service.</li>

<li>Install: this will install and configure the Web module and EARs on the
target server.</li>

<li>Start: this will start the server once the service has been installed
on it. The server-config.wsdd file will be generated.</li>

<li>Test: this will provide various options for testing the service, such
as using the Web Service Explorer or sample JSPs.</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li class="substepexpand"><span>Select your server: the default server is displayed. If you
want to deploy your client to a different server click the link to specify
a different server.</span></li>

<li class="substepexpand"><span>Select your runtime: the default runtime is displayed. If you
want to deploy your client to a different runtime click the link to specify
a different runtime.</span></li>

<li class="substepexpand"><span>Select the client project: the project containing the project
selected in your workspace is displayed. To select a different project and
EAR click on the project link.</span> Ensure that the project selected
as the Client Web Project is different from the Service Web Project, or the
service will be overwritten by the client's generated artifacts.</li>

<li class="substepexpand"><span>Monitor the Web service: this will send the Web service traffic
through the TCP/IP Monitor, which allows you to watch the SOAP traffic generated
by the Web service and to test this traffic for WS-I compliance. Alternately
you can manually set up a TCP/IP monitor as described in <a href="../../org.eclipse.wst.wsi.ui.doc.user/tasks/tmonitor.html">Using the TCP/IP Monitor to test Web services</a></span></li>

</ol>

</li>

<li><span>Web Service Proxy page: This panel shows the options for the proxy.
It lists the folder where the proxy will be generated, and you can optionally
create custom mappings between namespaces and packages.</span></li>

<li><span>Web Service Namespace to Package Mappings page: if you selected
 <span class="uicontrol">Define custom mapping for namespace to package</span> on
the previous page, you can enter your custom mapping pairs on this page by
clicking  <span class="uicontrol">Add</span>.</span></li>

<li><span>Web Service Client Test page: This page displays if you selected
to test your client. Select the test facility that you will use to test the
proxy, and the methods that you want included in the proxy. Note that the
Universal Test Client (UTC) is only compatible with Web service clients deployed
on WebSphere<sup>®</sup> servers.</span>
</li>

<li><span>Click  <span class="uicontrol">Finish</span>. If you have selected to test
the proxy, the test client will open in a browser window.</span></li>

</ol>

<div class="section"><p>The generated Java bean proxy provides a remote procedure
call interface to the Web service. The sample Web application demonstrates
how to code the proxy file.</p>
<p>Once you have generated your Java client
proxy, you may test the methods of the Web service through the proxy using
Web Services sample JSPs or the Universal test client.</p>
<ul class="wsclienttestoptions">
<li>If you have selected to test the generated proxy using Web service JSPs,
the proxy is launched in a Web browser at the following URL: <samp class="codeph">http://localhost: <var class="varname">port</var>/ <var class="varname">WebProject</var>Client/sample<em>BeanName</em>/ <var class="varname">WebServiceName</var>/TestClient.jsp</samp> You
can use this sample application to test the Web service by selecting a method,
entering a value for the method, and clicking  <span class="uicontrol">Invoke</span>.
The result of the method will display in the results pane.</li>

<li>If you have selected to test the Web service using the Web Services Explorer,
the Explorer will open. Select the operation you want to test, enter the required
information, and click  <strong>Go</strong>. The result will display in the Status pane.</li>

</ul>

development documentation.</p>

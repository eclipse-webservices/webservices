<h1 class="topictitle1">Creating a Web service from a Java bean using the Apache Axis1 runtime
environment</h1>




<div><p>The Web Service wizard assists you in creating a new Web service,
configuring it for deployment, and deploying the Web service to a server.
Once your Web service is deployed, the wizard assists you in generating the
client proxy and sample application to test the Web service. When you have
completed testing, you can publish your Web service to a UDDI Business Registry
using the Export wizard.</p>

<div class="p"><div class="p">Prerequisites:<ol>
<li id="twsbeana__createtomcatlink"><a name="twsbeana__createtomcatlink"><!-- --></a>If you are using the Apache Jakarta Tomcat servlet
container as your server, you must install it, configure an instance of it,
and create a Web project targeted to it as described in <a href="ttomcatserv.html">Creating an Apache Tomcat server and Web project</a></li>

<li>Create or import a bean into the Java™ source folder of the Web project. To
import, select the <strong>Java Resources: src</strong> folder, and from the file menu
select <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Import</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">General</span>
 &gt; <span class="uicontrol">File System</span></span> and browse to where your

<li class="stepexpand"><span>Switch to the Java EE perspective (<span class="uicontrol">Window &gt; Open Perspective
&gt; Java EE</span>).</span></li>

<li class="stepexpand"><span>In the Project Explorer view, select the bean that you created
or imported into the source folder of your Web project.</span></li>

<li class="stepexpand"><span>Click  <span class="uicontrol">File &gt; New &gt; Other</span>.</span> Select<span class="uicontrol">Web
Services</span> in order to display the various Web service wizards.
Select the  <span class="uicontrol">Web Service</span> wizard. Click  <span class="uicontrol">Next</span>.
</li>

<li class="stepexpand"><span>Web Services page: select  <span class="uicontrol">Bottom up Java bean Web service</span> as
your Web service type, and enter the URI to the WSDL, WSIL, or HTML file that
will be used to generate the service.</span>
<a name="twsbeana__createstep4ul"><!-- --></a><ol type="a" id="twsbeana__createstep4ul">
<li class="substepexpand"><span>Select the stages of Web services development that you want
to complete using the slider:</span> <ul>
<li>Develop: this will develop the WSDL definition and implementation of the
Web service. This includes such tasks as creating the modules which will contain
the generated code, WSDL files, deployment descriptors, and Java files when
appropriate.</li>

<li>Assemble: this ensures the project that will host the Web service or client
gets associated to an EAR when required by the target application server.</li>

<li>Deploy: this will create the deployment code for the service.</li>

<li>Install: this will install and configure the Web module and EARs on the
target server.</li>

<li>Start: this will start the server once the service has been installed
on it. The server-config.wsdd file will be generated.</li>

<li>Test: this will provide various options for testing the service, such
as using the Web Service Explorer or sample JSPs.</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li class="substepexpand"><span>Select your server: the default server is displayed. If you
want to deploy your service to a different server click the link to specify
a different server.</span></li>

<li class="substepexpand"><span>Select your runtime: the default runtime is displayed. If you
want to deploy your service to a different runtime click the link to specify
a different runtime.</span></li>

<li class="substepexpand"><span>Select the service project: the project containing the project
selected in your workspace is displayed. To select a different project and
EAR click on the project link.</span> Ensure that the project selected
as the Client Web Project is different from the Service Web Project, or the
service will be overwritten by the client's generated artifacts.</li>

<li class="substepexpand"><span>If you want to create a client, select the type of proxy to
be generated and repeat the above steps for the client.</span></li>

<li class="substepexpand"><span>Publish the Web service: this will launch the Web Services Explorer
to publish your Web service to a UDDI registry.</span></li>

<li class="substepexpand"><span>Monitor the Web service: this will send the Web service traffic
through the TCP/IP Monitor, which allows you to watch the SOAP traffic generated
by the Web service and to test this traffic for WS-I compliance. Alternately
you can manually set up a TCP/IP monitor as described in <a href="../../org.eclipse.wst.wsi.ui.doc.user/tasks/tmonitor.html">Using the TCP/IP Monitor to test Web services</a></span></li>

WSDL name will be listed.</span> You have the following options:<ul>
<li>Select the methods to expose.</li>

<li>Select the encoding style. RPC/Encoded is the recommended encoding style
for the Axis runtime environment. This encoding method is not WS-I compliant.</li>

<li>Select if you want to customize the package to namespace mappings.</li>

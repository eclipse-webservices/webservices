<!--PTPP0002 for the Topology Preference Page-->
<description>This table respresents the the types of projects available into which you can generate a Web services client. You cannot add or remove project types, however you can change the order in which they appear in the Web services wizard. This is useful if you are creating several Web services that use the same type of client project because you can set that client project type as the default. To change the order, select a project type and use the up and down arrows to move it within the list. Changing the order of the list does not restrict your ability to select any of the options.</description>

<context id="PPRM0005">
<!--Skeleton merge-->
<description>This check box is disabled by default.  If this check box is enabled, when a
skeleton file of the same name already exists in the workspace, the newly
generated skeleton file will merge with the existing skeleton file.  Enable this to preserve code that you have already modified in the existing skeleton
files.  
</ br>
Note that when this preference is enabled, if you change the return type
of an interface, the resulting skeleton file will have a method returning the
type as defined in the new interface but would have a method body from the
original skeleton file (which would be returning a different type).  This will
result in an compilation error that the you will have to correct manually.

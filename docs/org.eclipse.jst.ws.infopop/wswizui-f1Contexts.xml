<!-- First Page-->
<description>On this page select the artifact from which your Web service or client will be created, and the stages of Web services development that you want
to complete:
<ul>
<li>Develop: this will create the service code</li>
<li>Assemble: </li>
<li>Deploy: this will create the deployment code for the service</li>
<li>Install: this will install the service on the chosen server</li>
<li>Start: this will start the server once the service has been installed on it</li>
<li>Test: this will provide various options for testing the service</li>
</ul>
Select the server and runtime for your Web service or client, and whether or not you want to publish or monitor the service.

<context id="WSWSCEN0010">
<!--Web service type combo box of the First Page-->
<description>Select the type of Web service you want to create. A bottom-up service creates a service from a Java bean or EJB, while a top-down service will create 
a service from a WSDL file and then create a skeleton Java bean or EJB for you to implement later.</description>
</context>

<context id="WSWSCEN0014">
<!--Monitor checkbox of the First Page-->
<description>Monitor the Web service: this will send the Web service traffic
through the TCP/IP Monitor, which allows you to watch the SOAP traffic generated
by the Web service and to test this traffic for WS-I compliance.</description>
</context>

<context id="WSWSCEN0012">
<!--Launch UDDI check box of the First Page-->
<description>Publish the Web service: this will launch the Web Services Explorer
to publish your Web service to a UDDI registry.</description>
</context>

<context id="WSWSCEN0020">
<!--Service implementation field of the First Page-->
<description>Enter the URI to the WSDL, WSIL, or HTML file that
will be used to generate the service</description>
</context>

<context id="WSWSCEN0021">
<!--Service slider of the First Page-->
<description>Select the stages of Web services development that you want
to complete using the slider:
<ul>
<li>Develop: this will create the service code</li>
<li>Assemble: </li>
<li>Deploy: this will create the deployment code for the service</li>
<li>Install: this will install the service on the chosen server</li>
<li>Start: this will start the server once the service has been installed on it</li>
<li>Test: this will provide various options for testing the service</li>

a different server.</description>
</context>

<context id="WSWSCEN0023">
<!--runtime link of the First Page-->
<description>Select your runtime: the default runtime is displayed. If you
want to deploy your service to a different runtime click the link to specify
a different runtime.</description>

<context id="WSWSCEN0024">
<!--projects link of the First Page-->
<description>Select the service project: the project containing the project
selected in your workspace is displayed. To select a different project and
EAR click on the project link. Ensure that the project selected
as the Client Web Project is different from the Service Web Project, or the
service will be overwritten by the client's generated artifacts.</description>

<context id="WSWSCEN0025">
<!--client type combo of the First Page-->
<description>The Java bean client proxy that is generated provides a remote procedure call interface to the Web service.</description>

<context id="WSWSCEN0026">
<!--Client slider of the First Page-->
<description>Select the stages of Web services client development that you want
to complete using the slider:
<ul>
<li>Develop: this will create the client code</li>
<li>Assemble: </li>
<li>Deploy: this will create the deployment code for the client</li>
<li>Install: this will install the client on the chosen server</li>
<li>Start: this will start the server once the client has been installed on it</li>

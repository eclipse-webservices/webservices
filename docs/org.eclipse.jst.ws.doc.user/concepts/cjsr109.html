<h1 class="topictitle1">JSR 109 and JSR 921- Implementing Enterprise Web services</h1>
<div><p>JSR 109 and JSR 921 (Implementing Enterprise Web Services) define
the programming model and run-time architecture to deploy and look up Web
services in the J2EE environment; more specifically, in the Web, EJB, and
Client Application containers. One of its main goals is to ensure vendors'
implementations interoperate.</p>
<p>JSR 109 and JSR 921 build on top of JAX-RPC to cover the use of JAX-RPC
in a J2EE environment, as well as the implementation and deployment of Web
services to a J2EE application server. JSR 109 and JSR 921 define a set of
XML-based deployment descriptors to standardize Web services and Web service
client deployments in the J2EE environment. These tools support
JSR 109 for J2EE 1.3 and JSR 921 for J2EE 1.4.</p>

<div><a href="cjaxrpc.html" title="JAX-RPC stands for Java API for XML-based RPC, also known as JSR 101. It is a specification that describes Java Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and conventions for building Web services and Web service clients that use remote procedure calls (RPC) and XML. It standardizes the Java to WSDL and WSDL to Java mappings, and provides the core APIs for developing Web services and Web service clients on the Java platform. Often used in a distributed client/server model, an RPC mechanism enables clients to execute procedures on other systems.">JAX-RPC</a></div></div>

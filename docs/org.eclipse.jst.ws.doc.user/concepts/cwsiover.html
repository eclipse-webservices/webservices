<h1 class="topictitle1">Web services interoperability (WS-I)</h1>
<div><p>WS-I is an organization designed to promote Web service interoperability
across platforms, operating systems, and programming languages.</p>
<p>For more information on WS-I, refer to their Web site:  <a href="http://www.ws-i.org/" target="_blank">http://www.ws-i.org/</a>.
This site contains resources such as an overview of Web services interoperability,
usage scenarios, and specifications.</p>
<p>WS-I Basic Profile is a outline of requirements to which WSDL and Web service
protocol (SOAP/HTTP) traffic must comply in order to claim WS-I conformance.
The Web services WS-I validation tools currently support WS-I Simple SOAP
Binding Profile 1.0 (WS-I SSBP) which builds on the WS-I Basic Profile, and
the WS-I Attachments Profile 1.0 (WS-I AP). To view the specifications, refer
to the WS-I Web site, and under  <span class="uicontrol">Deliverables</span> select
 <span class="uicontrol">Basic Profile</span>.</p>
<p>Depending on the type of Web service being created, you may or may not
want your Web service to comply with the WS-I profiles. The default level
of compliance is to generate a warning if a non WS-I SSBP complaint Web service
option is selected and to ignore any non WS-I AP compliant selections. You
can set the level of WS-I compliance at the workspace or project level. The
Web services wizards, the WebSphere<sup>Â®</sup> run-time environments, the WSDL editor,
and other Web services tools provided support and encourage the development
of WS-I compliance services.</p>

The Web services WS-I validation tools support the level of WS-I
compliance outlined in the WS-I Basic Profile 1.1, the WS-I Simple SOAP Binding
Profile 1.0 (WS-I SSBP), and the WS-I Attachments Profile 1.0 (WS-I AP). You
can choose to make your Web service compliant or non-compliant, depending
on your needs. For example, encoded style (RPC/encoded), SOAP over JMS protocols,
and secured Web services, are not WS-I compliant.</li>

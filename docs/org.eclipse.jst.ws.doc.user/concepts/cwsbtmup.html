<h1 class="topictitle1">Creating bottom-up Web services</h1>
<div><p>Web services can be created using two methods: top-down development
and bottom-up development. Bottom-up Web services development involves creating
a Web service from a Java™ bean, enterprise bean, URL, DADX file,
or ISD.</p>
<p>Although bottom-up Web service development may be faster and easier, especially
if you are new to Web services, the top-down approach is the recommended way
of creating a Web service.</p>
<p>When creating a Web service using a bottom-up approach, first you create
a Java bean
or EJB bean and then use the Web services wizard to create the WSDL file and
Web service.</p>

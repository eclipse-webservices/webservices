<h1 class="topictitle1">Tools for Web services development</h1>
<div><p>Tools are provided to assist with the following aspects of Web services
development:</p>
<ul><li> <span class="uicontrol">Discover</span>. Browse the UDDI Business Registries
or WSIL documents to locate existing Web services for integration.</li>
<li> <span class="uicontrol">Create or Transform</span>. Create bottom-up Web services
from existing artifacts, such as Java™ beans, enterprise beans, URLs that
take and return data, DB2<sup>®</sup> XML Extender calls, DB2 Stored Procedures, and SQL queries.
Create top-down Web services from WSDL discovered from others or created using
the WSDL Editor.</li>
<li> <span class="uicontrol">Build</span>. Wrap existing artifacts as SOAP accessible
services and describe them in WSDL. The Web services wizards assist you in
generating a Java client proxy to Web services described in WSDL
and in generating Java bean skeletons from WSDL.</li>
<li> <span class="uicontrol">Deploy</span>. Deploy Web services into the WebSphere<sup>®</sup> Application
Server or Tomcat test environments. Secure Web services running on WebSphere Application
Server.</li>
<li> <span class="uicontrol">Test</span>. Test Web services running locally or remotely
in order to get instant feedback.</li>
<li> <span class="uicontrol">Develop</span>. Generate sample applications to assist
you in creating your own Web service client application.</li>
<li> <span class="uicontrol">Publish</span>. Publish Web services to a UDDI v2 or
v3 Business Registry, advertising your Web services so that other businesses
and clients can access them.</li>
</ul>
<div class="p">Some of the Web service tools available and their uses include the following:<ul><li>Use the Web Services Client wizard to create the Java client
to a deployed Web service and to test the Web service.</li>
<li>Use the Web Services wizard to create, deploy, test, and publish Web services
bottom-up from existing Java beans and enterprise beans, or top-down
from WSDL. The Web Services wizard supports the generation of the Java bean
proxy and a sample application.</li>
<li>Publish your Web service to a UDDI Business Registry using the Web Services
Explorer.</li>
<li>The Unit Test UDDI wizard installs, configures, and removes a Private
UDDI Registry.</li>
<li>The Java Beans for XML Schema wizard enables you to generate Java beans
from schema.</li>
<li>The IBM<sup>�</sup> Web
Services Explorer assists you in discovering and publishing your Web service
descriptions.</li>
<li>Use the WSDL validator to check for structural and semantic problems in
WSDL files.</li>
<li>WS-I compliance can be validated using several tools, such as the WSDL
validator, the Web service and client wizards, and a TCP/IP monitor.</li>
<li>The deployment settings for a Web service can be modified using the J2EE
deployment descriptor editors. Double-click any deployment descriptor to launch
the appropriate editor.</li>

<h1 class="topictitle1">Web Services Description Language (WSDL) reference</h1>
<div><p>A WSDL document defines services as collections of network endpoints,
or ports. In WSDL, the abstract definition of endpoints and messages is separated
from their concrete network deployment or data format bindings. This allows
the reuse of abstract definitions: messages, which are abstract descriptions
of the data being exchanged, and port types which are abstract collections
of operations. </p>
<div class="section"><p>The concrete protocol and data format specifications for a particular
port type constitutes a reusable binding. A port is defined by associating
a network address with a reusable binding, and a collection of ports define
a service. Hence, a WSDL document uses the following elements in the definition
of network services:</p>
<ul><li> <span class="uicontrol">Types</span>: a container for data type definitions using
some type system (such as XSD).</li>
<li> <span class="uicontrol">Message</span>: an abstract, typed definition of the
data being communicated.</li>
<li> <span class="uicontrol">Operation</span>: an abstract description of an action
supported by the service.</li>
<li> <span class="uicontrol">Port Type</span>: an abstract set of operations supported
by one or more endpoints.</li>
<li> <span class="uicontrol">Binding</span>: a concrete protocol and data format specification
for a particular port type. The binding is usually SOAP and the encoding and
data formatting regulations used (also known as the style) is usually literal
(this includes document/literal, and sometimes rpc/literal).</li>
<li> <span class="uicontrol">Port</span>: a single endpoint defined as a combination
of a binding and a network address.</li>
<li> <span class="uicontrol">Service</span>: a collection of related endpoints.</li>
</ul>

<p>The
various WSDL elements can be structured in many ways. It can be in one single
WSDL file or in mulitple WSDL files. If the IBM<sup>®</sup> WebSphere<sup>®</sup> or AXIS 1.0 run-time environment
are selected, Rational<sup>®</sup> Developer
products generate one single WSDL file containing in-line schema. If the IBM SOAP
run-time environment is selected, Rational Developer products generate
multiple WSDL and XSD files by default.</p>

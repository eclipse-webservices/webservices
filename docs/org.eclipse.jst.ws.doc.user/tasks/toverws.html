<h1 class="topictitle1">Developing Web services</h1>
<div><p>Use Web services tools to discover, create, and publish Web services
that are created from Javaâ„¢ beans, enterprise beans, and WSDL files.
You can create of Web services using a top-down approach (which starts with
a WSDL file) or a bottom-up approach (which starts with a Java bean
or EJB).</p>
<div class="section"><p>In this release, the development path that you would typically
follow to create and publish a Web service is as follows:</p>
</div>
<ol><li><span>Create a Web project.</span></li>
<li><span>Create or import an artifact to be turned into a Web service.</span></li>
<li><span>Create a Web service.</span></li>
<li><span>Publish a business entity.</span></li>
<li><span>Publish a Web service.</span></li>
</ol>
<div class="section"><p>For instructions on performing these tasks, refer to the list of
related topics at the end of this topic.</p>
<p>Web tools assist you in developing
Web applications that you can configure as a Web service. Web applications
are developed in a Web project, and Server tools allow you to use the server
test environment to test and deploy your Web services.</p>

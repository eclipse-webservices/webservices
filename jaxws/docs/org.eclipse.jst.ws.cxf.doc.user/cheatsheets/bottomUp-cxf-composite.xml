      <intro>
         This cheat sheet will guide you through the individual steps to setup the Apache CXF runtime, create an Apache Tomcat server,  a Dynamic Web Project enabled for Apache CXF Web services development  and create a JAX-WS Web service from a Java implementation bean, deploy it to Apache Tomcat and test it using the Web Services Explorer.

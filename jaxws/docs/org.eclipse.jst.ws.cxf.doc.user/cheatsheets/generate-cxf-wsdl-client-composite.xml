      <intro>
         This cheat sheet will guide you through the individual steps to generate a JAX-WS client from a WSDL document using Apache CXF.
         <br/>
         <br/>
The generated client will include a main() that when run will connect to the remote service and invoke every operation on that remote service.
         <br/>
         <br/>
To assist you along the way, wizards and commands will be available for you to launch automatically.

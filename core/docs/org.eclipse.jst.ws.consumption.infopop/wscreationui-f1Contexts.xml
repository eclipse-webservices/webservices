<!-- First Page-->
<description>On this page select the artifact from which your Web service or client will be created, and the stages of Web services development that you want to complete:
- Develop: this will create the service code
- Assemble: this ensures that the project that will host the Web service or client gets associated to an EAR when required by the target application server
- Deploy: this will create the deployment code for the service
- Install: this will install the service on the chosen server
- Start: this will start the server once the service has been installed on it
- Test: this will provide various options for testing the service
Select the server and runtime for your Web service or client, and whether or not you want to publish or monitor the service.

<!--Web service type combo box of the First Page-->
<description>Select the type of Web service you want to create. A bottom-up service creates a service from a Java bean or EJB, while a top-down service will create a service from a WSDL file and then create a skeleton Java bean or EJB for you to implement later.</description>

<context id="WSWSCEN0014">
<!--Monitor checkbox of the First Page-->
<description>Monitor the Web service: this will send the Web service traffic through the TCP/IP Monitor, which allows you to watch the SOAP traffic generated by the Web service and to test this traffic for WS-I compliance.</description>

<context id="WSWSCEN0012">
<!--Launch UDDI check box of the First Page-->
<description>Publish the Web service: this will launch the Web Services Explorer to publish your Web service to a UDDI registry.</description>
